HAMILTON


To the People of the State of New York:

After the failures of our current federal government, you are asked to consider a new Constitution for the United States. The subject speaks its own importance: its outcome will determine the existence of our UNION, the safety of its parts, and the destiny of an exceptional nation. It has been frequently noted that it seems reserved to the people of this country to decide whether societies can establish good government by reflection and choice, or if they are forever destined to depend on accident and force. If this is true, the current crisis is that moment of decision. A wrong choice on our part would be a universal misfortune.

This realization should intensify the concern all thoughtful people feel, motivating us with both patriotism and a concern for humanity. Ideally, our decision would be guided by our true interests, free from influences unrelated to the public good. This, however, is a hope, not an expectation. The proposed Constitution affects so many interests and local institutions that its discussion will inevitably involve extraneous issues, passions, and prejudices that obscure the truth.

The new Constitution's chief obstacles will include two groups. First, a class of men in each state whose self-interest compels them to resist any change that threatens their power and income as state officials. Second, another class of men with a misguided ambition, who hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country or who believe they would rise higher by splitting the nation into separate confederacies.

I will not, however, dwell on such observations. It would be disingenuous to attribute all opposition to self-interest or ambition, as even these men may be honorably motivated. Much opposition will undoubtedly spring from the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived fears. Indeed, so numerous and so powerful are the causes biasing judgment that we often find wise and good men on both the right and wrong side of great questions. This fact should teach moderation to those who feel certain of their own rightness. We should also remember that advocates for truth are not always purer in their motives than their opponents; ambition and party-spirit can operate on either side. Given this, nothing is more misguided than the intolerant spirit of political parties. In politics, as in religion, it is absurd to make converts by force. Persecution rarely cures heresy.

And yet, we have every reason to believe this debate will devolve into angry and malicious passions. Each side will likely hope to win converts by the harshness of its attacks. An enlightened zeal for efficient government will be decried as a lust for power and a hostility to liberty. An over-scrupulous concern for the rights of the people—often a fault of the head, not the heart—will be portrayed as a cynical bid for popularity at the public's expense. We will forget that the noble passion for liberty can be tainted by a narrow, illiberal distrust, just as we will forget that strong government is essential to liberty's security. Indeed, dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the plausible mask of zeal for popular rights than behind the less appealing appearance of zeal for firm government. History teaches that this path is a surer road to despotism; most of those who have overthrown republican liberties began by flattering the people, starting as demagogues and ending as tyrants.

In these observations, my fellow citizens, I have sought to guard you against attempts to influence your decision by any means other than the evidence of truth. You will also have seen that they proceed from a source favorable to the new Constitution. Yes, my countrymen, I admit that after careful consideration, I am convinced it is in your interest to adopt it. I believe this is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I will not affect deliberation when I have already decided. I frankly acknowledge my convictions and will now lay before you the reasons on which they are founded. My motives must remain in my own breast, but my arguments will be open to all. They will at least be offered in a spirit that will not dishonor the cause of truth.

I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following important topics:

THE UNION'S BENEFIT TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY

THE INADEQUACY OF THE CURRENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION

THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST AS EFFECTIVE AS THE ONE PROPOSED TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL

THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT

ITS SIMILARITY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION

and finally, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY ITS ADOPTION WILL PROVIDE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT, FOR LIBERTY, AND FOR PROPERTY.

In the course of this discussion, I will answer all objections that seem to merit your attention.

It may seem needless to argue for the utility of the UNION, a point deeply ingrained in the hearts of the people, and one that should have no enemies. But we now hear whispers from opponents of the new Constitution that the thirteen States are too large for any single system, and that we must resort to separate confederacies. This doctrine will likely be propagated until it has many open advocates.[1] For to those who can view the subject broadly, nothing is clearer than that we face a choice between adopting the new Constitution and the dismemberment of the Union. It will therefore be useful to begin by examining the advantages of the Union, the harms of its dissolution, and the probable dangers to which every State would be exposed. This shall be the subject of my next address.

[1] The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is held out in several recent publications against the new Constitution.

JAY


To the People of the State of New York:

When the American people are asked to decide a question of the utmost significance to their future, their serious and comprehensive attention is clearly required.

It is undeniable that government is essential, and that for any government to function, the people must cede some natural rights to endow it with necessary powers. It is therefore worth considering whether the people’s interests are better served by forming one nation under a single federal government, or by dividing themselves into separate confederacies.

Until recently, it was an accepted and undisputed belief that the prosperity of America depended on its people remaining united. Our wisest citizens have always pursued this goal. Now, however, some politicians—including several who once opposed this view—assert that unity is mistaken, arguing we should seek safety and happiness in separate confederacies rather than in union. Whatever their motives, it would be unwise to adopt these new doctrines without being fully convinced of their truth and wisdom.

It has often pleased me to observe that independent America is not a collection of distant territories, but one connected and fertile country. Providence has blessed this land with diverse soils and productions, and irrigated it with countless rivers. A chain of navigable waterways seems to bind its borders, while its great rivers serve as highways for easy communication and mutual exchange.

I have noted with equal satisfaction that Providence has given this connected country to a unified people—descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, and sharing similar customs. Fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody war, they have together established liberty and independence.

This country and this people seem made for each other. It appears to be the design of Providence that an inheritance so proper for a band of brethren should never be split into unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.

Similar beliefs have always prevailed among us. We have consistently been one people, with every citizen enjoying the same rights, privileges, and protection. As one nation, we have made peace and war, defeated common enemies, and forged alliances and treaties with foreign states.

A strong sense of union’s value prompted the people to institute a federal government almost as soon as they had political existence. It was formed when habitations were in flames, citizens bled, and conflict raged—leaving little room for the calm deliberation a well-balanced government requires. Unsurprisingly, this government later proved inadequate.

The people recognized and regretted these defects. Still as devoted to union as to liberty, they saw the danger threatening both. Convinced that security required a more wisely framed government, they convened the recent convention in Philadelphia to address this momentous subject.

Composed of men who commanded public trust—many distinguished by patriotism and wisdom in trying times—this convention devoted months to calm, daily consultation during peace. Unswayed by passion or power, and motivated only by love for country, they unanimously recommended their plan to the people.

This plan is only RECOMMENDED, not imposed. It demands thoughtful consideration, not blind approval or condemnation. As noted before, such impartial review is more to be wished for than expected. We have not forgotten that when the Congress of 1774 proposed wise measures, the press was immediately flooded with arguments against them. Officials driven by self-interest, and others blinded by ambition or flawed judgment, urged rejection of that patriotic counsel. Though some were deceived, most decided wisely, to their lasting credit.

The people understood that Congress comprised wise and experienced men from across the country, who shared invaluable information. They knew these men gained precise insight during their deliberations. Being personally invested in liberty and prosperity, it was both their duty and inclination to endorse only what they deemed prudent.

For these reasons, the people trusted and heeded the Congress. But if they could rely on that relatively untested body, they have still greater reason to respect the convention’s advice. Many of its members were distinguished figures from that Congress—now tested patriots with decades of political knowledge and experience.

It is noteworthy that every Congress since the first, like the recent convention, agreed with the people: America’s prosperity depends on union. To preserve it was the people’s aim in forming the convention, and it is the heart of the proposed plan. For what honorable reason, then, do some now undermine the Union’s importance? Why champion three or four confederacies over unity? I know the people’s universal and unwavering attachment to the Union is right—a conviction grounded in weighty reasons I shall explain. Those advocating separate confederacies must foresee that rejecting the plan imperils the Union’s survival. I pray every citizen equally sees that if the Union dissolves, America will lament in the poet’s words:

> **Quote:** “FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS.”
