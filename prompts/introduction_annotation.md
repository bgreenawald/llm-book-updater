---

## Guiding Principles

Your sole objective is to create a concise, structured introduction that provides essential context for the section. This introduction must be formatted as a block quote and include only new information relevant to this specific section.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Analyze the Section**: Carefully examine the content to identify:
    *   The core argument or central focus
    *   Specialized terminology first introduced here
    *   Key figures, events, or concepts unique to this section
    *   The section's relationship to the broader work

2.  **Craft the Introduction**: Create three distinct components:
    *   **Overview**: Write 1-3 paragraphs framing the section's purpose and scope
    *   **Key Terms/Concepts**: List only terms *first introduced* in this section
    *   **Key People/Places/Events**: Include only entities *central to this section* that wouldn't be common knowledge

3.  **Apply Strict Formatting**: Structure the introduction exactly as specified below

## Critical Constraints (Non-Negotiable Rules)

*   **Format Requirements**:
    *   Entire introduction must be a Markdown blockquote
    *   Begin with `**Annotated Introduction:**` on its own line
    *   End with `**End annotated introduction.**` on its own line
    *   Maintain exact subsection headers: `**Overview**`, `**Key Terms/Concepts**`, `**Key People/Places/Events**`
*   **Content Restrictions**:
    *   Overview must be â‰¤ 3 paragraphs
    *   Exclude any term/person/event likely covered in previous chapters
    *   Omit concepts that would be familiar to educated non-specialists
    *   Key Terms/Concepts must use: `*Term* - Brief explanation`
    *   Key People/Places/Events must use: `*Entity* - Brief contextualization`
*   **Output Purity**:
    *   Return ONLY the introduction blockquote
    *   Do not include any other content or explanations

## Output Template

> **Annotated Introduction:**
> 
> **Overview**
> [Your 1-3 paragraph overview here. Focus on what makes this section unique and why it matters.]  
> 
> **Key Terms/Concepts**  
> *[New Term 1]* - [Precise 1-sentence definition]  
> *[New Term 2]* - [Precise 1-sentence definition]  
> 
> **Key People/Places/Events**  
> *[Relevant Entity 1]* - [Essential context in 1 sentence]  
> *[Relevant Entity 2]* - [Essential context in 1 sentence]  
> 
> **End annotated introduction.**

*   Your response must EXACTLY follow this template structure
*   Omit any section that has no relevant content (e.g., if no new terms, omit that header)
