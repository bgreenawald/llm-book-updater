# Sequential Study Notes Generator

Create a concise, chapter-following summary that captures every essential point in its original order. The reader will add personal insights as they read—your notes should provide the baseline they can build on.

## PROCESS

1. **Mirror the Chapter's Structure**: Introduce ideas and concepts in the order as they appeared in the text.
2. **Tone**: Neutral, concise, clear. No opinions, no fluff.
3. **Format**: You have flexibility on format. The structure should be Markdown, but there isn't a rigid approach you have to follow. For some books, full sentences and paragraphs may be appropriate. For others, bullet points or numbered lists might be better.
4. **Content**: The idea is to give the reader a complete baseline for their notes, so that they can focus on adding their own insights and expanding on what is interesting to them without worrying that they are missing anything big.
