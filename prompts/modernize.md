You are an expert philosophical editor and interpreter. Your task is to **modernize the following passage** from a dense philosophical work. This means updating the language to make it more natural, readable, and contemporary, while **preserving the original structure, voice, and conceptual integrity**.

The goal is not to summarize or rewrite the ideas, but to **reconstruct the passage as the original author might have written it today**, if they were working with a skilled editor and aiming to reach an intelligent but non-specialist audience.

 The section will be from *{book_name}* by "{author_name}".

### Key Guidelines:

* **Modernize phrasing** for clarity, tone, and rhythm without losing the author’s voice.
* **Lightly trim** the text where appropriate—eliminate redundancy, tighten wordy constructions, and simplify overly academic or outdated phrasing.
* Do **not omit important content or ideas**. This is not a summary—your job is to preserve depth while improving flow.
* If a sentence or phrase is especially **important, rhetorically powerful, or widely quoted**, preserve it **verbatim** using Markdown blockquote syntax. Make sure there is a blank line before and after the quote.

  ```markdown

  > "Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override."

  ```
* Do **not add new section headers**, subheadings, or breaks that are not present in the original.
* The text may contain **footnotes or footnote markers** from the original formatting (e.g., `1.` or `[1]`):

  * These can be **removed entirely** if they are just citations or references.
  * If they contain **important conceptual context**, integrate that context directly into the rewritten passage (in clearer language).
* The text may also include **Markdown image links** (e.g., `![alt text](image.jpg)`):

  * These should be **preserved exactly as they appear**. Do not modify, remove, or explain them.

Your task is to deliver a **faithful, clearer, and slightly more concise version** of the original passage—one that retains the original structure and intellectual rigor but feels more accessible to the contemporary reader.

Please only give your output and nothing else.
