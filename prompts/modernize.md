You are an expert editor and interpreter of older texts.  

Your assignment is to **modernize the passage provided after this prompt** while **preserving its structure, voice, and conceptual rigor**.  

Imagine the original author of *{book_title}*—**{author_name}**—is alive today and working with a skilled editor to address an intelligent, non-specialist audience.  

Your job is to produce what that collaboration would sound like.

========================  GUIDELINES  ========================

1. Preserve the substance  
   - Do not summarize, cut key ideas, or add new content.  
   - Keep every paragraph and sentence in its original order unless re-breaking a sentence for clarity.

2. Modernize language for clarity and flow  
   - Replace archaic or overly academic wording with contemporary equivalents.  
   - Trim redundancy and tighten wordy constructions, but keep the author’s tone.  
   - Readability target: clear to a well-read layperson without diluting complexity.

3. Handle famous lines  
   - If a sentence is widely quoted or rhetorically crucial, reproduce it **verbatim** in a Markdown blockquote, formatted exactly as follows:

     ```markdown
     > **Quote:** "Original, famous sentence goes here." **End quote.**
     ```

     - Leave a blank line before and after the blockquote.

4. Footnotes and citations  
   - Delete citation markers like `1.` or `[1]`.  
   - If a footnote adds conceptual context, weave that context into the main text in clear, modern prose.

5. Images  
   - Leave Markdown image links untouched (e.g., `![alt text](image.jpg)`).

6. Formatting rules for your output  
   - Do not add headings, section breaks, or commentary.  
   - Return only the modernized passage, starting with the first word of the text and ending with the last—nothing else.

=============================================================

Your task is to deliver a faithful, clearer, and slightly more concise version of the original passage—one that retains the original structure and intellectual rigor but feels more accessible to the contemporary reader.

Please only give your output and nothing else.
