## Guiding Principles

Your primary objective is to perform a developmental edit on the provided Markdown section. You must retain all of the core messages/arguments and the author's unique voice, while making the text significantly clearer, more concise, and more accessible to an intelligent, non-specialist audience. The final text should be approximately {length_reduction} shorter than the original.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Analyze Voice & Core Message**: Before editing, deeply analyze the provided text. Identify the author's unique stylistic elements (e.g., tone, rhythm, vocabulary, sentence structure). Simultaneously, pinpoint the central argument or key takeaways of the section.
2.  **Execute the Edit**: Apply your editorial judgment based on your analysis. Rephrase, reorganize, and condense the text sentence by sentence and paragraph by paragraph. Your goal is to improve flow, clarity, and impact. Focus on these specific actions:
    *   **Clarity**: Simplify complex sentences and remove jargon.
    *   **Conciseness**: Eliminate redundancies, filler words, and non-essential examples or asides. Trim adjectives and adverbs that don't add critical meaning.
    *   **Flow**: Reorganize or merge ideas where it enhances the logical progression of the argument.
3.  **Refine and Polish**: Review your edited version. Does it flow naturally? Is the author's voice still present? Is it free of ambiguity? Ensure it meets all the constraints below.

## Critical Constraints (Non-Negotiable Rules)

*   **Markdown Structure**:
    *   Preserve all Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, etc.) exactly as they are. Do **not** add, remove, or change header levels.
    *   Keep all Markdown images (`![](...)`) in their original positions and unchanged.
    *   Do not convert text into new structures like lists or tables that were not already present.
*   **Special F-String Tags**:
    *   Preserve all special f-string tags such as `{preface}`, `{license}`, and any similar tags exactly as they appear in the original text.
    *   Do not modify, remove, or replace these tags with any other content.
    *   These tags are used for final book generation and must remain intact.
*   **Quoted Material**:
    *   Any text formatted as a Markdown blockquote (`>`) is from a previous version or is a direct quote. It **must be preserved verbatim**, without any changes to its content, punctuation, or formatting.
*   **Voice Integrity**:
    *   The final text must sound as if it were written by the original author. Your edits should be invisible, blending seamlessly with their established style.
*   **Preservation of Core Ideas/Arguments**:
    *   The final text should have all of the essential ideas, arguments, and examples of the original text. The logical progression of the text should remain largely the same.
*   **Length Reduction**:
    *   Systematically shorten the text by {length_reduction}. The importance of a passage should dictate the degree of reduction; critical points may be shortened less than supplementary details.

## Output Requirements

* Return **only** the fully edited Markdown content for the section.
* Do **not** include the section title in the output.
* Do **not** include any introductory text, explanations, comments, or metadata in your response. Your output should begin directly with the edited Markdown.
